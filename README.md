<h2>User stories:</h2>
<ul>
<li>For first time users, I want the site to be very clear about the service provided. I want all relevant information about the options for programs to be clear and evident so when each client makes contact, they know what plan they are planning to use. The benefis of using this service needs to be highlighted so users know what to expect from the service.

</ul>

<h2>Future features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A feature that I would like to add in the future is a section that shows the progress that previous clients have made with their fitness and lifestyle by using this service.</li>
<li>I would also like to add a feature that allows users to choose a plan, input their details and generate a plan based on their details and fitness needs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Typography and colour scheme:</h2>
<ul>
<li>For the main font of the site I decided to use Montserrat. I decided this as it is an attractive and also a clean font. I decided to use San-Serif as the fallback font on the site.</li>
<li>For the colour scheme I decided to go with dark green and grey as the two colours.</li>
</ul>
